## 📄 Key Deliverables

### 🛡️ Network Vulnerability Assessment

- Identified Critical Vulnerabilities (e.g., EternalBlue - CVE-2017-0144)
- Traffic captured and analyzed using Wireshark
- Risk Matrix and remediation plan provided
- CVSS scoring and patch recommendations

### 🌐 Web Application Pentesting

- SQL Injection, XSS, and Authentication Bypass
- Tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
- Recommendations based on OWASP Top 10
- Manual testing and automated scan results

## 📊 Risk Assessment Snapshot

| Severity | Count | Example                               |
|----------|-------|----------------------------------------|
| Critical | 3     | SMB RCE, Unpatched CVEs                |
| High     | 7     | Weak Auth, Cleartext Protocols         |
| Medium   | 12    | Info Disclosure, Outdated Software     |
| Low      | 8     | Verbose Server Banners, Port Leaks     |

## 📌 Recommendations

- Patch management for critical CVEs (e.g., MS17-010)
- Disable insecure services (Telnet, SMBv1)
- Enforce MFA and strong password policies
- Segregate network via VLANs and firewalls
- Implement continuous monitoring and incident response
