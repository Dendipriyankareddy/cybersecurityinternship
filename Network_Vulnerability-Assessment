# 🔍 Task 1: Network Vulnerability Assessment

## 🧪 Objective
Assess a simulated corporate network for vulnerabilities through scanning, traffic analysis, and automated vulnerability tools.

## ✅ Steps Performed

1. **Network Scanning (Nmap):** Identified open ports and running services.
2. **Traffic Analysis (Wireshark):** Detected unencrypted data and misconfigurations.
3. **Vulnerability Scanning (Nessus):** Automated detection of known CVEs.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Nmap
- Wireshark
- Nessus

## 📄 Files Included
- `Scans/nmap_scan.txt`: Nmap results
- `Reports/Nessus_Report.pdf`: Detailed Nessus output
- `Screenshots/`: Visual proof of findings

## 🛡️ Key Findings
- SMBv1 Enabled (High Risk)
- Open FTP Port (Medium Risk)

## 🧯 Recommendations
- Disable legacy protocols
- Apply latest patches
- Enforce firewall policies
