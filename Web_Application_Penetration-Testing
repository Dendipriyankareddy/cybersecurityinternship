# 🛡️ Task 2: Web Application Penetration Testing

## 🧪 Objective
Perform penetration testing on a vulnerable web application to detect OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## ✅ Steps Performed

1. **Setup**: Deployed DVWA and bWAPP in a local LAMP environment.
2. **Automated Scanning**: Used Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP.
3. **Manual Testing**:
   - SQL Injection
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- Metasploit (for exploit testing)

## 📄 Files Included
- `Payloads/xss_payloads.txt`: Sample injection payloads
- `BurpSuite_Reports/burp_scan.html`: Vulnerability scan report
- `Screenshots/`: Screenshots of exploited vulnerabilities

## 🧯 Recommendations
- Sanitize user input
- Implement CSRF tokens
- Use parameterized queries
